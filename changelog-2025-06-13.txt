Changelog for June 13, 2025
===========================

1. Added a clickable star (☆/★) next to each move in the move list page to allow adding/removing favorites.
2. Implemented a favorites system using localStorage, with functions to add, remove, and display favorite moves.
3. Ensured all ID comparisons and storage use string type for consistency and reliability.
4. Created a favorites page (favorites.html) that lists all favorite moves, each with a clickable cross (✖) to remove from favorites.
5. Made the star button always centered on its own line below the move name on the main page.
6. Reserved vertical space for move names to prevent layout shifting when names wrap to a second line.
7. Changed move containers from <p> to <div> for valid HTML structure.
8. Updated the navigation bar on all main pages to include a sticky Favorites link on the right, with a gold star icon.
9. Fixed issues with favorites not displaying due to ID type mismatches.
10. Added a 'Clear Favorites' button to both the favorites page and the move list page, allowing users to clear all favorites at once.
11. Improved the appearance of the non-favorite (empty) star by making its outline thin gray, so it stands out less.
12. Ensured the move list page allows toggling favorites directly by clicking the star.
13. Ensured all scripts are loaded in the correct order for proper functionality.
14. Added a difficulty filter (beginner, intermediate, advanced) to the move list and index pages, with a dropdown and button. The filter is centered below the navbar and works with the "Get new moves" button.
15. Added a one-time changelog modal (Bootstrap) to index.html, shown only once per user per update.
16. Commented out unavailable moves and renumbered all move IDs in one_hand, two_hand, and aerial arrays to be globally unique and sequential, skipping commented-out moves.
17. Ensured there are no jumps or duplicates in move IDs across all arrays (IDs are now globally unique site-wide).

All changes were made to improve the user experience, consistency, and reliability of the favorites feature, move filtering, and site navigation.
